# OIBSIP--TaskNo-2--Portfolio
I've just built my own personal portfolio website during my internship using only HTML and CSS. It has a home section, an about section where I talk about my skills and education, a projects section, and a contact section.This project helped me learn how to organize different parts of a webpage, adjust spacing, arrange content, and add different sections for more accessibility and  for a polished look. I'm looking forward to sharing it on GitHub to show my growth in web development and contribute to the web development community.
